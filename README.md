### Pretty damn secure!
Firebase handles all security needed for the application, feel safe!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process
The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. <br>

The goal of this application was to create an experience that felt personalised to each user to some extent, making it as clean as possible. cosnidering certain constraints, such as experience with kotlin, firebase and Android studio, I wanted to push myself as far as I could in order to get the best possible outcome for the project, while there is still work to do, this project is still something to be proud of!
<br>
Throughout the conceptual process of this application , I wanted to create an application that really looks good and works well, this project was more focus on design considering that firebase did a lot of the heavy lifting for me. I wanted to focus on considering the reusability of components more. I learned a lot about Firebase and Kotlin.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

####    Front end Implementation

* Jetpack compose components instead of XML to create the layout 
* reusable components made to keep styling consistent, eg. Button component or Profile header 
* Live chat updates that show the time of message and profile image of sender
* Last message shown

#### Firebase implementation
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Users:
    * Users are able to create an account
    * Users get real time data 
    * Personalise your account and add information about yourself.
    * Get an overview of all your friends or add more by email


#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Learning how to work with Kotlin and adjusting to MVVM is an ongoing challenge, I think this is going to take some work to get used to as opposed to MVC, Kotlin is also the first real programming language that Ive worked with. I really enjoy it, but I need to learn more about it before I will consider working with it on a project or put it on my CV as a skill. 
* Firebase, I had to learn a lot about firebase and BAS, using things such as Promise.all() has really helped me in using firebase and getting data. Firebase has been a challenge due to my comfort with MONGODB , Express and Node. This is however a good thing.
* There are bugs in the application such as rerendering issues, this is due to my approach on how to get data, I want to improve the whole app to make everything as fast as possible.


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* it's always a highlight working with new programming languages, especially one thats so close to Java (my dream language to learn).

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Adding friends to your friendslist and being able to create a conversation with your friends


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
* I want to fix all the bugs in the application and improve my data updates
* Fix the fact that users can start a conversation with someone if the other participant created your conversation

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
## Final Outcome
